# JAR2PKG

Takes a JAR file and packages it up to distribute on the Mac operating system.

## This is using this guide here: https://centerkey.com/mac/java/

# This is easier than following the steps every time, and I'm too lazy to Google another solution so I made this.

# Usage

- You might need to elevate the .sh script
  - chmod 755 JAR2PKG.sh
- Run Script
- Run PKG File
- Program Installed in Applications Folder
